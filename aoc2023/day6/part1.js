there are actually 4 different ways you could win: 
you could hold the button for 2, 3, 4, or 5 milliseconds at the start of the race.

To see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can beat the record in each race; in this example, 
if you multiply these values together, you get 288 (4 * 8 * 9).

Determine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race. What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?
